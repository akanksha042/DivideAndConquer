# Divide and Conquer

This repository contains a collection of Divide and Conquer questions solved in Java. The Divide and Conquer approach is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find various Divide and Conquer questions along with their solutions implemented in Java. Each question is designed to demonstrate the application of the Divide and Conquer approach to solve algorithmic problems efficiently.

## Questions

The following questions are included in this repository:

1. **Majority Element**: Given an array of integers, find the majority element (the element that appears more than n/2 times), if it exists.
   - Solution: [Java implementation of Majority Element](link-to-majority-element)

2. **Merge Sort**: Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
   - Solution: [Java implementation of Merge Sort](link-to-merge-sort)

3. **Quick Sort**: Implement the quick sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
   - Solution: [Java implementation of Quick Sort](link-to-quick-sort)

4. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**: Given a rotated sorted array of integers and a target value, find the index of the target element in the array (or return -1 if it is not present).
   - Solution: [Java implementation of Search in Rotated Sorted Array](link-to-search-in-rotated-sorted-array)

...

Each question includes a brief description and a link to the original problem statement (if available). The solution for each question is implemented in Java and provided as a separate file.
